                            Welcome to SplitSnap. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to privacy and how your information is handled when you use our receipt scanning bill-splitting application.

                            SplitSnap uses third-party artificial intelligence services to process receipt images and extract text for bill-splitting calculations. While we strive to protect your privacy, please be aware that receipt data is transmitted to these services for processing.

                            SplitSnap uses third-party artificial intelligence services to process receipt images and extract text information for bill-splitting calculations. When you scan a receipt, the image is transmitted to these AI services for processing, and the extracted data is returned to the app.

                        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">
                            SplitSnap&apos;s data processing involves third-party AI services. Here&apos;s how your data is handled:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">

                            <li className="mb-2">We do not store your receipt data on our servers after processing</li>

                            <li className="mb-2">Bill splitting calculations are performed within the app after receiving extracted data</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">
                            Standard app functionality services provided by Apple (App Store downloads, TestFlight distribution, and crash reporting) are governed by Apple&apos;s privacy policy and remain unchanged.
                        </p>

                        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Camera Permission</h2>
                        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">
                            SplitSnap requires camera permission to function properly. This permission is used exclusively for scanning receipts. When you take a photo of a receipt:
                        </p>
                        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                            <li className="mb-2">The image is transmitted to third-party AI services for text extraction</li>
                            <li className="mb-2">The image is only stored temporarily during the processing session</li>
                            <li className="mb-2">We do not store the image on our own servers after processing</li>

                        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">
                            You can revoke camera permission at any time through your device settings, though this will limit the app&apos;s functionality as receipt scanning is our core feature.

                            Data processed during your session is automatically cleared when you close the app or start a new receipt scanning session. We do not maintain a history of your receipts or transactions on our servers. However, third-party AI services may have their own data retention policies.
