## Project Overview

This is a landing page for SplitSnap, a bill-splitting iOS application. The landing page is built with Next.js and React, and is designed to be a static website. It showcases the app's features, explains how it works, and provides a link to download the app via TestFlight. The styling is done using Tailwind CSS.
